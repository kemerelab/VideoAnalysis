VideoAnalysis
=============

This is a stand-alone OpenCV-based video analysis program designed to annotate and navigate through video files, perform lens correction from camera calibration data, and to perform automated animal tracking.

Currently implemented:
1. Fast keyboard-based video navigation
2. tracking coming soon!

The code depends on features of [OpenCV 3.0.0 beta](http://opencv.org/downloads.html), Qt 5+, and OpenCV-contrib (tracking-api). It has been tested in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
